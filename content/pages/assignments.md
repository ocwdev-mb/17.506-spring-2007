Research Paper
--------------

The major requirement is a 20-30 page research paper that resembles a dissertation prospectus. The paper must define a question, specify variables and their measurement, identify underlying causal mechanisms, address the relevant literature, and develop hypotheses. Most students will need to formally present this paper in the last sessions of the course.

Ses #2 Short Assignment
-----------------------

A discussion of current definitions and measurements of ethnicity in major political science journals:

Below is a list of all articles from the _American Political Science Review_ and the _American Journal of Political Science_ from the last five years that contain the words "ethnic" or "ethnicity" in the title. Students should choose two of the articles that are most relevant to their research interests (except for Posner, which will be considered in Ses #3), summarize the argument, describe the operationalization of ethnicity, and consider alternative definitions.
